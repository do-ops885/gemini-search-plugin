## Performance Metrics

### Technical Query Performance

| Query Type | Avg Response Time | Token Usage | Cache Hit Value |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Error Resolution | 8-12 sec | 18,000 | Very High |
| Documentation | 10-15 sec | 22,000 | High |
| Comparisons | 12-18 sec | 28,000 | Medium |
| Security | 10-16 sec | 24,000 | Medium |

### Cache Effectiveness

Technical queries benefit significantly from caching:

- **Common errors**: 95% cache hit rate (after initial search)
- **Documentation**: 85% cache hit rate
- **Latest versions**: 40% cache hit rate (frequent updates)
