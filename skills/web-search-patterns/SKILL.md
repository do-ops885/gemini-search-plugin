# Web Search Patterns

This document outlines best practices and patterns for using the Gemini Search plugin.

## Search Query Optimization

### Query Structure
- Use specific keywords rather than broad terms
- Include context words when needed
- Avoid ambiguous phrases
- Formulate questions as direct queries

### Effective Search Patterns

#### Informational Queries
- "What is [topic]?"
- "[Topic] overview"
- "How does [process] work?"

#### Comparative Queries
- "[A] vs [B]"
- "Difference between [A] and [B]"
- "Compare [A] vs [B]"

#### Problem-Solving Queries
- "[Problem] solution"
- "How to fix [problem]"
- "Troubleshooting [issue]"

## Advanced Search Techniques

### Boolean Operations
- Use quotes for exact phrases: "exact phrase"
- Use AND, OR, NOT operators
- Use wildcards: [term]* or [term]?

### Source Filtering
- Domain-specific searches: [query] site:domain.com
- Date filtering when available
- Content type filtering

## Best Practices

### Before Searching
1. Clarify your search intent
2. Think of multiple ways to phrase the question
3. Consider related terms or synonyms

### After Search
1. Verify source reliability
2. Cross-reference important facts
3. Note the search date for time-sensitive topics

## Performance Considerations
- Be specific to reduce irrelevant results
- Use the cache when re-searching similar topics
- Check /search-stats to understand usage patterns
